In this example:

We have an HTML file containing a button (clickButton), a text input (textInput), and a div (output) where we'll display the output.
In the JavaScript file:
    -We select the button, input, and output elements using getElementById.
    -We attach an event listener to the button for the 'click' event. When the button is clicked, it updates the text content of the output div to indicate that the button was clicked.
    -We attach an event listener to the text input for the 'keypress' event. When the 'Enter' key is pressed, it retrieves the value entered in the text input, displays it in the output div, and clears the input field.
This example demonstrates how to respond to user interactions using event listeners and handle events such as clicks and keypresses.
