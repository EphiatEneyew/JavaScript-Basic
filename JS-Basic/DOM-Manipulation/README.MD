In this CODE:

-We have HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons.
-We use JavaScript to select elements by their IDs.
-We attach event listeners to buttons to perform actions:
           - When the "Add Paragraph" button is clicked, a new paragraph is dynamically added to the container.
           -When the "Change Content" button is clicked, the text content of the first paragraph is updated.
           -When the "Highlight" button is clicked, the second paragraph toggles its class to apply or remove highlighting styles.
-This example demonstrates the core concepts of selecting elements, modifying attributes and content, and responding to user interactions using JavaScript and the DOM.
