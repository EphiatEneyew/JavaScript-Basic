Example 1 demonstrates handling a SyntaxError when attempting to parse invalid JSON.
Example 2 demonstrates handling a TypeError when attempting to call a method on an undefined variable.
Example 3 demonstrates handling a ReferenceError when attempting to access an undefined variable.
Example 4 demonstrates handling a RangeError when attempting to manipulate an array index out of range.
